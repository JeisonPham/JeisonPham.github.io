                <p>I am 20 years old. I am currently attending school to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering and do web development as a fun side activity. I am currently looking for advice and any comments on my work, or I am willing to work on redesigning your website for free. 
                I like anything scientific related and have a dream of some day working on helping humans get to Mars. I also like to browse reddit, play various games (League, Warcraft, etc), and am a huge fan of anime and manga. I am currently learning Japanese and am studying for the N5 test.
